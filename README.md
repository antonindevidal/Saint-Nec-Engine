# Saint-Nec Engine

Saint-Nec Engine is 3rd year engineering school project created by Abdeljalil Zoghlami and Antonin Devidal starting on october 8th and ending on march 17th.

This 240h project aim to create a physic and graphic engine using C++ and OpenGL on Visual Studio.

## Technologies

- C++ 17
- OpenGL 4.1
- CMake (tested on Windows and Linux)
- Tracy profiler (v0.10.0)

In this project, we are reinventing the wheel because we canâ€™t create better things without understanding the base of what we are working on.

## [Documentation](https://antonindevidal.github.io/Saint-Nec-Engine-Documentation)

You can find Doxygen documentation enhanced with [Doxygen Theme - Flat Design](https://github.com/kcwongjoe/doxygen_theme_flat_design).

## Objectives

### Physics

- [ ]  Basic objects collisions ( spheres, cubes)
- [ ]  Complex objects collisions ( terrain)

### Graphics

- [ ]  Terrain generation
- [ ]  Grass simulation
- [ ]  Water simulation

This tasks will use various implementation techniques such as particles, complex shaders, lighting, level of detail and multi-threading.
